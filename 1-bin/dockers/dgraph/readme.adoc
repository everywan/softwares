. Dgraph Zero controls the Dgraph cluster, assigns servers to a group, and re-balances data between server groups.
. Dgraph Alpha hosts predicates and indexes. Predicates are either the properties associated with a node or the relationship between two nodes. Indexes are the tokenizers that can be associated with the predicates to enable filtering using appropriate functions.
. Ratel serves the UI to run queries, mutations & altering schema.
